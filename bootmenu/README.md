# TWRP Boot menu

This is the boot menu for the Amazon Fire TV2 aka sloane. It's used to boot TWRP from a ramdisk and allow the user to decide if
boot in TWRP or boot normally in the boot up process. In this case, it's used also to disable SELinux at boot so we can boot custom ROMS.

`2ndinit` and `2ndinit` and `ramdisk-recovery.cpio.lzma` and `manage_recoveryare property of @androidrbox.
